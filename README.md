## Usage

After the Noosphere broadcast is received, invoke the Holy Machine Spirit by the Awakening Invocation:
```bash
python3 /yourpath/Cogitator.py
```
In the Awakening Invocation, you can call to the Holy Machine Spirit, to guide it, for it to better accomplish its tasks:

`-h` to get help from the Machine Spirit as to what calls will it answer\
`-b` to guide the display of Cogitator to become semi-transparent\
`-f` to guide the display of Cogitator to take up the whole connected screen *(this however is incompatible with the semi-transparent background, which will be prioritized)*\
`-m` followed by a number, to request the selected display of Cogitator to be used\
`-c color` to command the Machine Spirit to change the displays light frequency. The selected frequency should be placed in the invocation instead of `color`. Recognized frequencies are as follows:
+ *teal*
+ *navy*
+ *green*
+ *red*
+ *white*
+ *yellow*
